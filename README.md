## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

- The @Res() decorator gives access to the underlying response object of expressjs (or fastify). However, try not to use it and stick with the nest way of handling responses to stay clear from incompatibilities of nest api and expressjs api.
- Encapsulate business domains inside a module. For example, a shopping cart has functionalities that are closely related and can be defined inside of a module.
- The `@Module()` decorator provides the metadata that nest uses to organize the structure of the app.
- DTOs are used to define the interface or shape of the input or output within our system. For example, in a post request we can use a DTO to define the interface or shape we are expecting to receive for the `body`. This can help us make sure that the post request payload has everything required that we need to run the rest of the code.
- DTOs are just simple objects. They don't contain any business logic, methods or testing.
- A best practice with DTOs is to mark each property with `readonly` to help maintain immutability.
- Dtos are useful for creating a bit of type safety within our application.
- Any backend app must validate the correctness of the data being sent to our app. Validating this data is the next important thing and nest uses validation pipes to address this issue.
- The `PartialType` function inherits all the properties and validation rules from the dto provided as its argument and marks each one of them as optional.
- When using TypeOrm, seeing the following log message indicates that the connection to db is successful: `TypeOrmModule dependencies initialized`.
- An entity represents the relationship between a typescript class and a database table. In fact, each class marked with the `@Entity()` decorator will create a sql table. The sql table name will be the class name in lowercase.
- TypeOrm supports repository design pattern, which means that each entity that we create has its own repository.
- The main idea of a provider is that it can inject dependencies. It means objects can create various relationship with each other and nest handle the logic of wiring up instances of objects together.
- Modules are used to encapsulate a closely related set of capabilities.
- Think of containers as running processes with some added encapsulation applied to it, making it isolated from the host and other containers.
- Relations are associations between two or more tables based on common fields from each table.
- Indexes are special lookup tables that database search engine use to speed up data retrieval.
- Database migration provides a way to incrementally update our database schema and keep it in sync with applications data model all while preserving existing data in our database.
